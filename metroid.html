    <h2>Metroid 1986 - Unity Remaster</h2>
    <h3>About the Project:</h3>
    <p>This is a Unity remaster of the first realm of the classic 1986 game <i>Metroid</i>, with a customized extra level that features a new mechanic. </p>
    <h3>My Contributions:</h3>
    <p>Remade the first realm of the NES video game Metroid and added a custom level to show off a custom mechanic. Created with <a href="https://github.com/TianzeMYou">Tianze You</a>.</p>
    <p>My contributions: Implemented the entire player (Samus), implemented every enemy (Zoomers, Reos, Skrees, Rippers, and Zebs), implemented the UI, and created the custom level layout</p>
    <p>The custom mechanic is the ability to walk on the celling with Samus's new Anti-Gravity Suit. Race through a custom made level to show off your physics-defining abilities.</p>
    <h3>Technology Used:</h3>
    <p>The remaster was developed using the Unity Game Engine, powered by the programming language C#. The WebGL build of the game is hosted on itch.io.
