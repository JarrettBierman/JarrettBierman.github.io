    <h3>About the Project:</h3>
    <p>This is a rapid prototype of a golf simulation / survival adventure video game. It was made as a project for EECS 494 in the Winter of 2023.</p>
    <h3>My Contributions:</h3>
    <p>With few exceptions, everything was made by me. A few notable exceptions include the Zombie prefab and animations, two sound effects, and some grass textures.</p>
    <p>Everything else, from the visuals to the mechanics to the music, was created by me in a two week time period.</p>
    <h3>Technology Used:</h3>
    <p>This game was developed using the Unity Game Engine, powered by the programming language C#. You can download the game for Mac or Windows below...</p>
